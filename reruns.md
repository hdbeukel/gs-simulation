Scheduled reruns
================

 - Track TP size (all).
 - Extensions of sign mismatch ratio (all):
 	- Restrict to rare alleles (MAF < 10%, 5%)
 	- Restrict to markers with sufficiently large effect
 	- Overlay box plots with effect magnitudes
 	- NOTE: store QTL-marker LD table including effects !!!
